# MSPB
This repository contains scripts for analyzing the MSPB dataset (a longitudinal Multi-Sensor dataset with Phenotypic trait measurements from honey Bees). 
- Dataset is made publicly available [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8371700).
- Check the [project webpage] for a quick intro().
Note that we are still working on the repo (e.g., updating links, uploading scripts, etc.).

## Dataset summary
We present a longitudinal Multi-Sensor dataset with Phenotypic trait measurements from honey Bees (MSPB). Data were continuously collected between May-2020 and April-2021 from 53 hives located at two apiaries in Québec, Canada. The sensor data included audio features, temperature, and relative humidity. The phenotypic measurements contained beehive population, number of brood cells (eggs, larva and pupa), Varroa destructor infestation levels, defensive and hygienic behaviors, honey yield, and winter mortality. Our study is amongst the first to provide a wide variety of phenotypic trait measurements annotated by apicultural science experts, which facilitate a broader scope of analysis on honey bees, such as bee acoustics analysis, multi-modal hive monitoring, queen presence detection, Varroa infection detection, hive population estimation, biological analysis of bees, etc.

## Applications
We here provide several use cases of this dataset. Scripts are written in Jupyter notebooks so that the outputs can be visualized. Each notebook is an independent task. Tasks employed in the paper are outlined as follows:

- Visualize the multi-sensor data pattern [notebook]()
- Early-prediction of hive winter survivability [notebook]()
- Prediction of hive population [notebook]()
