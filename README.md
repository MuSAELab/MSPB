# Nectar-CRSAD
This repository contains scripts for analyzing the Nectar-CRSAD beehive multi-sensor dataset. Detailed information about the dataset itself can be found at [paper link](). Note that we are still working on the repo (e.g., updating links, uploading scripts, etc.).

## Dataset
We present a longitudinal multi-sensor dataset collected from honey bees with rich phenotypic measurements. Data were continuously collected between May-2020 and April-2021 from 53 hives located at two apiaries in Qu√©bec, Canada. The sensor data included audio features, temperature, and humidity. The phenotypic measurements contained beehive population, number of brood cells, varroa infestation status, defensive and hygienic behavior, the weight of honey produced, and winter mortality causes. Our study is the first to its kind to provide a wide variety of phenotypic labels annotated by bee experts, which would facilitate a broader scope of beehive analysis. 

The dataset can be downloaded [here]().

## Applications
We here provide several use cases of this dataset. Scripts are written in Jupyter notebooks so that the outputs can be visualized. Each notebook is an independent task. Tasks employed in the paper are outlined as follows:

- Visualize the multi-sensor data pattern [notebook]()
- Early-prediction of hive winter survivability [notebook]()
- Prediction of hive population [notebook]()
